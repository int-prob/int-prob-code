[Ivan Corwin, Evgeni Dimitrov, "Transversal fluctuations of the ASEP, stochastic six vertex model, and  Hall-Littlewood Gibbsian line ensembles"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07180v1)

<!--more-->

We consider the ASEP and the stochastic six vertex models started with step
initial data. After a long time $T$ it is known that the one-point height
function fluctuations for these systems are of order $T^{1/3}$. We prove the
KPZ prediction of $T^{2/3}$ scaling in space. Namely, we prove tightness as $T$
goes to infinity of the height function with spatial coordinate scaled by
$T^{2/3}$ and fluctuations scaled by $T^{1/3}$. We prove these results by using
a connection discovered recently by Borodin-Bufetov-Wheeler between the
stochastic six vertex height function and the Hall-Littlewood process.
Interpreting this process as a line ensemble with a Gibbsian resampling
invariance, we show that the one-point tightness of the top curve can be
propagated to the tightness of the entire curve.
