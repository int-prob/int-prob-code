[Promit Ghosal, "Hall-Littlewood-PushTASEP and its KPZ limit"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07308v1)

<!--more-->

We study a new model of interactive particle systems which we call the
randomly activated cascading exclusion process (RACEP). Particles wake up
according to exponential clocks and then take a geometric number of steps. If
another particle is encountered during these steps, the first particle goes to
sleep at that location and the second is activated and proceeds accordingly. We
consider a totally asymmetric version of this model which we refer as
Hall-Littlewood-PushTASEP (HL-PushTASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ lattice where
particles only move right and where initially particles are distributed
according to Bernoulli product measure on $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. We prove
KPZ-class limit theorems for the height function fluctuations. Under a
particular weak scaling, we also prove convergence to the solution of the KPZ
equation.
