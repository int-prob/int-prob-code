[Cesar Cuenca, "BC Type Z-measures and Determinantal Point Processes"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07060v1)

<!--more-->

The (BC type) z-measures are a family of four parameter $z, z', a, b$
probability measures on the path space of the nonnegative Gelfand-Tsetlin graph
with Jacobi-edge multiplicities. We can interpret the $z$-measures as random
point processes $\mathcal{P}_{z, z', a, b}$ on the punctured positive real line
$\mathfrak{X} = \mathbb{R}_+\setminus\{1\}$. Our main result is that these
random processes are determinantal and moreover we compute their correlation
kernels explicitly in terms of hypergeometric functions.
  For very special values of the parameters $z, z'$, the processes
$\mathcal{P}_{z, z', a, b}$ on $\mathfrak{X}$ are essentially scaling limits of
Racah orthogonal polynomial ensembles and their correlation kernels can be
computed simply from some limits of the Racah polynomials. Thus, in the
language of random matrices, we study certain analytic continuations of
processes that are limits of Racah ensembles, and such that they retain the
determinantal structure. Another interpretation of our results, and the main
motivation of this paper, is the representation theory of big groups. In
representation-theoretic terms, this paper solves a natural problem of harmonic
analysis for several infinite-dimensional symmetric spaces.
