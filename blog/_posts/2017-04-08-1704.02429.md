[Cesar Cuenca, "Asymptotic Formulas for Macdonald Polynomials and the boundary of the  $(q, t)$-Gelfand-Tsetlin graph"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02429v1)

<!--more-->

We introduce Macdonald characters and use algebraic properties of Macdonald
polynomials to study them. As a result, we produce several formulas for
Macdonald characters, which are generalizations of those obtained by
Gorin-Panova in arXiv:1301.0634 [math.PR], and are expected to provide tools
for the study of statistical mechanical models, representation theory and
random matrices. As first application of our formulas, we characterize the
boundary of the $(q, t)-$deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph.
