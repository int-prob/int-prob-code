[Sevak Mkrtchyan, Leonid Petrov, "GUE corners limit of q-distributed lozenge tilings"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07503v2)

<!--more-->

We study asymptotics of $q$-distributed random lozenge tilings of sawtooth
domains (equivalently, of random interlacing integer arrays with fixed top
row). Under the distribution we consider each tiling is weighted proportionally
to $q^{\mathsf{vol}}$, where $\mathsf{vol}$ is the volume under the
corresponding 3D stepped surface. We prove the following Interlacing Central
Limit Theorem: as $q\rightarrow1$, the domain gets large, and the fixed top row
approximates a given nonrandom profile, the vertical lozenges are distributed
as the eigenvalues of a GUE random matrix and of its successive principal
corners. Our results extend the GUE corners asymptotics for tilings of bounded
polygonal domains previously known in the uniform (i.e., $q=1$) case. Even
though $q$ goes to $1$, the presence of the $q$-weighting affects non-universal
constants in our Central Limit Theorem.
