[Vadim Gorin, Mustazee Rahman, "Random sorting networks: local statistics via random matrix laws"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07895v2)

<!--more-->

This paper derives the bulk local limit of the swap process of uniformly
random sorting networks. The limit object is defined through a deterministic
procedure, a local version of the Edelman-Greene algorithm, applied to a two
dimensional determinantal point process with explicit kernel. The latter
describes the asymptotic joint law near $0$ of the eigenvalues of the corners
in the antisymmetric Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. In particular, the limiting
distribution of the first swap time at a given position is identified with the
limiting distribution for the closest to $0$ eigenvalue in the antisymmetric
GUE.
  The proofs rely on the determinantal structure and a double contour integral
representation for the kernel of random Poissonized Young tableaux.
