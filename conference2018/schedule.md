  <summary>Aspects of stationary states in multispecies exclusion and zero range
processes</summary>
<div style="background-color:#d9c9c9; padding:10px">I shall survey combinatorial aspects of stationary states of the
n-species totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (n-TASEP) and an
n-species totally asymmetric zero range process (n-TAZRP) on L-site
periodic chain. The topic will encompass matrix product formulas of
quantum R matrices from tetrahedron equation, combinatorial R in crystal
theory (theory of quantum groups at q=0), formulation of the Ferrai-Martin
type algorithm and n-line processes by crystals, 3D interpretation of
stationary probabilities, etc. n-TAZRP and n-TASEP turn out to be sister
models associated with the symmetric and the antisymmetric tensor
representations of U_q(\hat{sl}_L) and admit parallel description. (Joint

  <summary>Macdonald processes and KPZ equation in a half space</summary>
  <div style="background-color:#d9c9c9; padding:10px">
  Macdonald processes are a powerful tool to study exactly solvable
models in the KPZ universality class, such as directed polymers or
ASEP and, as a limit, the KPZ equation. Most available results
about these models are in a full space, for instance the KPZ
equation on the real line R. This talk is about integrable versions
of these models in a half-space and the KPZ equation on the half
line R_+. We will explain why a half space variant of Macdonald
processes seem to be the appropriate tool to study these half space
models and probe the effect of boudaries in KPZ growth. Joint work
with Alexei Borodin, Ivan Corwin and Michael Wheeler.

  <summary>Algebraic constructions of Markov duality functions</summary>
  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">Markov duality in spin chains and exclusion processes has found a
wide variety of applications throughout probability theory. We review the
duality of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and its
underlying algebraic symmetry. We then explain how the algebraic
structure leads to a wide generalization of models with duality, such as
higher spin exclusion processes, zero range processes, stochastic vertex
models, and their multi-species analogues.

  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">
  I will discuss 2+1 dimensional growth models in the Anisotropic KPZ
(AKPZ) class and recall the relation, predicted by Wolf, between
the Hessian of the speed of growth (as a function of the slope) and
the critical exponents of height correlations in space and time. In
particular, I will focus on an AKPZ model where, for a specific
slope, the stationary state is "rigid" (O(1) fluctuations uniformly
in space and time). The speed of growth turns out to be singular at
the rigid slope (its second derivatives diverge). The growth
process is defined via the shuffling algorithm for domino-tilings
with two-periodic edge weights.

  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">
  In this talk, we will discuss our recent progress
on the multi-time and multi-location distribution of periodic
TASEP. For a general initial condition, we evaluate this
distribution explicitly in terms of a multiple integral involving a
Fredholm determinant. With some assumptions on the initial
condition, we are able to compute the large time limit in the
so-called relaxation time scale. This is joint with Jinho Baik.

  <summary>A bijectivization of combinatorial identities behind integrable models</summary>
  <div style="background-color:#d9c9c9; padding:10px">Abstract: An integrability of many stochastic models is related to the existence of non-trivial combinatorial identities behind them. Two sources of such connections are Cauchy identities in models coming from Macdonald processes, and the Yang-Baxter equation in vertex models of statistical mechanics. I will discuss an idea of bijectivization (or coupling) of these identities.

percolation with geometric weights. This can be interpreted as the correlations of the height
function at a spatial point at two different times in the equivalent interpretation as a discrete
polynuclear growth model. The new approach is rather close to standard random matrix theory
(or determinantal point process) computations. I will give some background and also present
some aspects of the computations involved.

  <summary>Brownian bridges for late time KPZ fluctuations in finite volume</summary>
  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">
  Late time height fluctuations at the KPZ fixed point in finite
volume can be expressed for arbitrary initial condition in terms of
a deformation of the stationary eigenvector of TASEP, for which a
matrix product solution is known. With periodic boundaries, a
simpler reformulation of this matrix product representation allows
to express the generating function of the height at late time in
terms of conditional probabilities of non-intersecting Brownian
bridges with exponentially distributed distances between the
endpoints. Comparison with earlier exact Bethe ansatz asympotics
leads to explicit expressions involving half-integer polylogarithms
for specific initial conditions. Joint work with Kirone Mallick.

  <summary>Truncated linear statistics associated with the top eigenvalues of random
matrices</summary>
  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">
  Given an invariant random matrix ensemble with a joint distribution of
eigenvalues $P(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_N)$, we study the
distribution of a truncated linear statistics (TLS): 
$\tilde{L}=\sum_{n=1}^K f(\lambda_n)$ associated with the top $K$ ordered
eigenvalues $\lambda_1>\lambda_2\ldots>\lambda_N$. Motivated by the
statistical physics of fluctuating non-intersecting Brownian interfaces on a
solid substrate, we focus on the Laguerre ensemble with
$f(\lambda)=\sqrt{\lambda}$. Using a Coulomb gas method, we derive
the distribution of $\tilde{L}$ in the limit when $K\to \infty$, $N\to
\infty$ but with the fraction $0< \kappa= K/N<1$ fixed. We show that the
constraint that $\tilde{L}= \sum_{n=1}^K f(\lambda_n)$ is fixed,
    leads to an <i>infinite</i> order phase transition in the underlying Coulomb
gas. This transition corresponds to a change in the optimal charge density
in the Coulomb gas, from a density supported on two disjoint intervals (for
large $\tilde{L}$) to a density on a single interval (for small
$\tilde{L}$). In the small $\tilde{L}$ phase, the density has a
logaritmic divergence inside the bulk. Assuming that $f(\lambda)$ is
monotonous, we show that these features arise for any random matrix
ensemble and any TLS $f(\lambda)$, which makes our results robust and
universal.

  <summary>On shocks in the TASEP</summary>
  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">
 Abstract: The TASEP, moving rightward, runs into
traffic jams when the initial particle density to the left of the origin is
smaller than the density to the right. The density function satisfies Burgers'
equation and traffic jams correspond to its shocks. I will describe work with
Jeremy Quastel on a specialization of the TASEP, where we identify joint
fluctuations of particles at the shock by using determinantal formulae for
correlation functions of TASEP and its KPZ scaling limit. The limit process is
expressed in terms of GOE Tracy-Widom laws.

  <summary>KPZ equation limit for the six vertex model</summary>
  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">The Six Vertex (6V) model, initially introduced as a
model for ice, is an integrable model for tiling in two dimensions.
In this talk we consider symmetric and stochastic 6V models, and
show that, under certain scaling into the ferroelectric/disordered
phase critical point, fluctuations described by the
Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation arises.
<br>
Our approach utilizes the one- and two-point Markov duality enjoyed
by the stochastic 6V model. One-point duality gives the (so-called)
microscopic Hopf--Cole transform, and thereby exposes the
connection to KPZ equation. On the other hand, two-point duality
provides exact, analyzable formulas that help to establish certain
self-averaging, which is the key step in the proof given the
aforementioned transform.

  <summary>Nonequilibrium particle systems in inhomogeneous space</summary>
  <div style="background-color:#d9c9c9; padding:10px">
  I will discuss stochastic interacting particle systems in the KPZ universality
class evolving in one-dimensional inhomogeneous space. The
inhomogeneity means that the speed of a particle depends on its location. I
will focus on integrable examples of such systems, i.e., for which certain
observables can be written in exact form suitable for asymptotic analysis.
Examples include a continuous-space version of TASEP (totally asymmetric
simple exclusion process), and the pushTASEP (=long-range TASEP). For
integrable systems, density limit shapes can be described in an explicit
way. We also obtain asymptotics of fluctuations, in particular, around slow
bonds and infinite traffic jams caused by slowdowns.

  <summary>Open ASEP and KPZ equation</summary>
  <div style="background-color:#d9c9c9; padding:10px">
  We consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process on the half line and on a bounded interval with sources and sinks, which is called Open ASEP. In the full line, Bertini and Giacomin (1997) proved convergence under weakly asymmetric scaling of the height function to the solution of the KPZ equation on the line. We show that under weakly asymmetric scaling of the sources and sinks as well, the half line height function converges to the KPZ equation on the positive real line with Neumann boundary condition at zero; and the bounded interval height function converges to the KPZ equation on the unit interval with Neumann boundary conditions on both sides. This result demonstrates how the KPZ equation arises at the triple critical point (maximal current / high density / low density) of Open ASEP.  Our result is proved by applying microscopic Hopf-Cole transform. Joint work with Ivan Corwin.

  We describe recent results on the large deviations for the KPZ height
  both at late time and at short time.
  Using exact solutions the rate function at large time is obtained from 
  a Coulomb gas calculation. The rate function at short time is 
  also obtained for various initial conditions. The results are compared
  to high precision numerics on the directed polymer. Relations
  with results from the weak noise theory are also discussed.
