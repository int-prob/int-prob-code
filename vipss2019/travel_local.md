<h2 class="mb-3">Local details</h2>

<h3 class="mb-3">Classroom and discussion space</h3>

- Lectures and discussion sessions are in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/KgajNcWymQ8aP9SX8">Clark Hall</a>, room 107 (this is a large lecture room with planets)
- We have reserved the smaller classroom Clark 102 for discussions in
		the afternoons. It is available May 28-31 and June 3-7, but only
		**from 1pm to 5pm** (and possibly later, too)
- Additional space for discussions is available in the Math Department building (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DpLDp1go3uR5G5eR9">Kerchof Hall</a>). The building has several small lounges and seminar rooms:
	- seminar room 128 ("basement floor")
	- graduate lounge at the center of "basement floor"
	- lounge room 201
	- seminar room 326
	- large math lounge, room 314
	- large seminar room 317
	
	The building is open during working hours (so, not on May 27 and June 8). Feel free to use the lounges and seminar rooms if they are not occupied. This is summer time, and there are not much other activity in the math building.
- Lambeth residence area has a common building with two large lounges (details were sent in an informational email)
- There are many coffee shops in "the Corner" area, see below

<h3 class="mb-3">Internet access</h3>

On University of Virginia Grounds and in residence halls, there are two ways to get online:

1. If you have access to the global "eduroam" network, then it should work at University of Virginia

2. Guest wifi codes with instructions are available at the lecture hall and at check-in. Please email <a href="mailto:lenia.petrov@gmail.com">lenia.petrov@gmail.com</a> and I can send you a wifi code beforehand.

<h3 class="mb-3">Parking</h3>

If you come by car and stay at a residence hall, you don't need a car to get to the lectures. The car can be useful to get to the downtown, or 

1. Parking around the university is permit-based. However, some streets south of the university, but in walking distance, have unlimited free street parking (street names include Shamrock, Cherry, etc.). Please check the signs when you park
2. Parking is usually free and unlimited on weekends (and Monday, May 27 which is the Memorial Day) in all university parking lots
2. You can purchase a permit at University of Virginia parking and transportation office:
[Visitor parking information](https://parking.virginia.edu/visitor-parking);
[Parking rates (see "TEMPORARY PERMITS")](https://parking.virginia.edu/system/files/VisitorRates.pdf);
[office hours](https://parking.virginia.edu/contact) (closed on weekends and most likely on May 27). For Lambeth, the permit area is called "S2".

<h3 class="mb-3">Transportation</h3>

- Charlottesville has a reasonable [public bus system](http://www.charlottesville.org/departments-and-services/city-services/charlottesville-area-transit-cat). There is a free bus (we call it "Free Trolley")
which can get you from the university to the downtown. 

- University of Virginia has its own bus system "UTS" for on-Grounds transportation. These are usually blue-orange buses, and they are free to ride. The system operates during the summer school time. See [here](https://parking.virginia.edu/university-transit-service) for routes.

	There are several apps (for example, CAT) which display bus stops and
bus times, both for Charlottesville city and University of Virginia
buses. Google maps knows the city bus schedule, but is not
integrated with the university buses.

- Lime and Bird app-based electric scooters operate in Charlottesville, too.

<h3 class="mb-3">Residence halls</h3>

Participants staying at residence halls will be housed at 
[Lambeth Field Apartments](https://housing.virginia.edu/area/1171).
Further details about the stay will be emailed separately.

<h3 class="mb-3">Gym</h3>

University of Virginia has several [sports/recreational facilities](https://recsports.virginia.edu) which the participants have access to (the conference participants listed on this website can get the membership at $35/week). Refer to the following contact information for further actions:
- call the business office (M-F 9:00am to 5:30pm) at 434-924-3791  or 
- go in-person to the offices (M-F 9:00am to 5:30pm) at 
	- [Aquatic & Fitness Center](https://recsports.virginia.edu/afc) or
	- [North Grounds Rec Center](https://recsports.virginia.edu/ngrc) 


<h3 class="mb-3">Groceries, lunch, dinner</h3>

The summer school does not provide breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 
We provide coffee breaks with light snacks. They are served by the lecture hall (Clark 107).

In walking distance from Lambeth Field Apartments, there is Barracks Road Shopping center
which has a big grocery store ("Harris Teeter") and numerous restaurants and fast food. There is also "Food of all Nations" store in another direction, but also very close.
There is also "The Corner" area (intersection of Jefferson Park Ave, West Main, and University Ave)
which has many lunch options and also some convenience stores (smaller shops where one can get milk, snacks, etc).

<h2 class="mb-3">Travel</h2>

Charlottesville is a midsize college town located in Central Virginia,
2.5 hours (by car) south of Washington, DC. It offers great hiking in
the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains, numerous nice restaurants in the
downtown area, local wineries, and such. There are also several
interesting American history sites, like Monticello, the home of
Thomas Jefferson. The local airport code is **CHO**, and this airport is
the most comfortable way to getting to the town. Another close airport (1 hour drive) is Richmond (**RIC**). The closest major international airports
are Washington Dulles (**IAD**) and Washington Reagan (**DCA**). 

Unfortunately, almost no public
transportation or shuttles exist 
between RIC or IAD and Charlottesville (from DCA, Washington Metro + Amtrak is a lengthy but public option). 
Here are some options:
- (**NEW**) Megabus just launched cheap bus service between IAD and Charlottesville downtown. See [here](https://us.megabus.com/route-guides/charlottesville-to-dulles-washington-airport-iad-bus)
- One can rent a car from IAD, RIC, or DCA. During the conference, having a car is convenient but not essential - the University and the town are walkable.
- Another option is to take a taxi/Uber/Lyft. To/from IAD it is about $150 one way, which is comparable to a one-way car rental.
- A taxi service to the airport can be reserved in advance ([example](http://thecollegecab.com/Home_Page.html)).
- Depending on your flight time, you can use the Amtrak Manassas station which is within a 20-30 minute taxi ride (about $35) from IAD. Trains run about once a day. It may be a convenient option when going from Charlottesville to IAD as one can wait in the airport.

If you need any further help arranging travel details (for example, pooling a rental car from IAD), please email&nbsp;
