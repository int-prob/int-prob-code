On University of Virginia Grounds and in residence halls, there are two ways to get online:

2. Guest wifi codes with instructions are available at the lecture hall. If needed, please email <a href="mailto:lenia.petrov@gmail.com">lenia.petrov@gmail.com</a> and I can send you a wifi code before the first lecture.

<h3 class="mb-3">Parking</h3>

If you come by car and stay at a residence hall, you don't need a car to get to the lectures. The car can be useful to get to the downtown, or 

1. Parking around the university is permit-based. However, some streets south of the university, but in walking distance, have unlimited free street parking (like Shamrock, Cherry, etc.). Please check the signs when you park
2. Parking is usually free and unlimited on weekends (and Monday, May 27 which is the Memorial Day) in all university parking lots
2. You can purchase a permit at University of Virginia parking and transportation office:

<h2 class="mb-3">Travel</h2>

Charlottesville is a midsize college town located in Central Virginia,
2.5 hours (by car) south of Washington, DC. It offers great hiking in
the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains, numerous nice restaurants in the
downtown area, local wineries, and such. There are also several
interesting American history sites, like Monticello, the home of
Thomas Jefferson. The local airport code is **CHO**, and this airport is
the most comfortable way to getting to the town. Another close airport (1 hour drive) is Richmond (**RIC**). The closest major international airports
are Washington Dulles (**IAD**) and Washington Reagan (**DCA**). 

Unfortunately, almost no public
transportation or shuttles exist 
between RIC or IAD and Charlottesville (from DCA, Washington Metro + Amtrak is a lengthy but public option). 
Here are some options:
- (**NEW**) Megabus just launched cheap bus service between IAD and Charlottesville downtown. See [here](https://us.megabus.com/route-guides/charlottesville-to-dulles-washington-airport-iad-bus)
- One can rent a car from IAD, RIC, or DCA. During the conference, having a car is convenient but not essential - the University and the town are walkable.
- Another option is to take a taxi/Uber/Lyft. To/from IAD it is about $150 one way, which is comparable to a one-way car rental.
- A taxi service to the airport can be reserved in advance ([example](http://thecollegecab.com/Home_Page.html)).
- Depending on your flight time, you can use the Amtrak Manassas station which is within a 20-30 minute taxi ride (about $35) from IAD. Trains run about once a day. It may be a convenient option when going from Charlottesville to IAD as one can wait in the airport.

If you need any further help arranging travel details (for example, pooling a rental car from IAD), please email&nbsp;
