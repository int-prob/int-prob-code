<h2 class="mb-3">Travel</h2>

Charlottesville is a midsize college town located in Central Virginia,
2 hours (by car) south of Washington, DC. It offers great hiking in
the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains, numerous nice restaurants in the
downtown area, local wineries, and such. There are also several
interesting American history sites, like Monticello, the home of
Thomas Jefferson. The local airport code is **CHO**, and this airport is
the most comfortable way to getting to the town. Another close airport (1 hour drive) is Richmond (**RIC**). The closest major international airports
are Washington Dulles (**IAD**) and Washington Reagan (**DCA**). 

Unfortunately, no public
transportation or shuttles exist 
between RIC or IAD and Charlottesville (from DCA, Washington Metro + Amtrak is a lengthy but public option). 
Here are some options:
- One can rent a car from IAD, RIC, or DCA. During the conference, having a car is convenient but not essential - the University and the town are walkable.
- Another option is to take a taxi/Uber/Lyft. To/from IAD it is about $150 one way, which is comparable to a one-way car rental.
- A taxi service to the airport can be reserved in advance ([example](http://thecollegecab.com/Home_Page.html)).
- Depending on your flight time, you can use the Amtrak Manassas station which is within a 20-30 minute taxi ride (about $35) from IAD. Trains run about once a day. It may be a convenient option when going from Charlottesville to IAD as one can wait in the airport.

If you need any further help arranging travel details (for example, pooling a rental car from IAD), please email&nbsp;
