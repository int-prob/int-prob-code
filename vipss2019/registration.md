<h2 class="mb-3">Registration and financial support</h2>

If you plan to attend the summer school, please **register using the form below**.

We have NSF support to cover accommodation at a University of Virginia residence hall, 
and to partially contribute towards travel expenses (the travel support amount depends on the number of interested participants).
Preference will be given to graduate students, postdocs, early career researchers, and members of underrepresented groups. 

Accommodation for participants will be booked
at one of the University of Virginia residence halls
([example](http://housing.virginia.edu/area/1171) - but note that the bedrooms will be single occupancy). Because of coordination with 
housing services, we require that participants wishing to stay at
residence halls
register by January 5, 2019.

You are welcome to book your own accommodation in Charlottesville - there are ample hotel and Airbnb options,
especially if booking at least 2-3 months in advance. *However, we cannot fully cover this accommodation option
under our financial support*. We can only contribute a part of these accommodation costs, up to \$45/night
(in fact, this might suffice if booking multi-bedroom Airbnb options for several participants). 

**Deadlines**:
- To request residence hall accommodation: **January 5, 2019**
- To request financial support: **March 1, 2019**
- General registration: **April 20, 2019**
