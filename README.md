# Focused Research Group in Integrable Probability

This is a GitHub pages repository for the [Integrable Probability FRG webpage](https://integrable-probability.github.io/). 
These ReadMe notes are intended to document how the webpage is organized, and facilitate its collaborative editing.

A few things to note first:
- The source code is hosted here and is automatically compiled into a static HTML that is displayed as the webpage
- Any change in the code is reflected on the webpage (within a couple of minutes)
- This repository, including every change, is public
- There is a number of "collaborators" with direct access to modifying the website. Every change is recorded and can be easily reverted, so edits in general cannot break the website
- Any other GitHub user can submit any edits (a "pull request") which can be approved by collaborators and included in the code
- Changes to the code can be made in browser. For larger changes, clone the git repository ~~~~git clone https://github.com/integrable-probability/integrable-probability.github.io~~~~

## Organization of the webpage

## ToDos
1. Add a pretty picture or two on the front page and/or somewhere else
2. Link to homepages by graduate students if they exist
3. As FRG events (workshops, conferences, summer schools) are organized, create and maintain their dedicated webpages, possibly as subpages of this website
4. Create a forum-like space to discuss Integrable Probability, and open it to anonymous comments during FRG events. 
This item needs a lot of technical thinking
